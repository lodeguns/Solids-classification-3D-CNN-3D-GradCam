# Solids-classification-3D-CNN-3D-GradCam
Here we introduce the problem of 3D solids classification (spheres and octahedra) through a 3D CNN.

The source is written in tensorflow/python.

We implemented a 3D GradCam model, in order to underline the most relevant 3D volumes of the original image that are useful for the classification.
